- Calculate **BMI** and assess fitness levels.  
- Use **Gemini model** to generate expert-style health advice.  
- Provide **lifestyle tips, motivational quotes, and dashboards** for better visualization.  
- Ensure **dark mode UI** for professional medical dashboard look.

## ✅ Solution
The application provides:
- **BMI Calculation** with category insights (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).  
- **Fitness Score Analysis** with tailored recommendations.  
- **AI-powered health guidance** using Gemini model.
